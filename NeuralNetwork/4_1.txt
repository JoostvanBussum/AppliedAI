Exercise 4.1 — NOR-Gate.
Determine weights and a threshold for a perceptron that would act as a NOR-gate
with three inputs.

Answer:
w1 = -1
w2 = -1
w3 = -1
Threshold t = 0

Exercise 4.2 — Neural ADDER.
Make an adder out of perceptrons. Draw the network and give the corresponding
weights and biases.
